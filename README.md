After exploring the basics of the individual services, you will be introduced to strategies to accomplish the exam objectives relevant to Keystone, Glance, Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Swift, Heat, and troubleshooting. Finally, you'll benefit from the special tips section and a practice exam to put your knowledge to the test.
